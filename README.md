# Creation of flight database using MySQL
### Jan 2022 – Mar 2022
### Tools Used: R Studio, ML Models


•	This project involved analyzing a dataset of domestic flight times in the US across three time periods ((the late 90s, mid 2010s, and during the pandemic).
•	The dataset was processed by removing redundancies, defined schemas, created logical ER diagrams, and performed data normalization. Ran SQL queries and visualized the data.
•	Created graphs and built interactive dashboards to observe the performance, cancellation, and delay of the flights with respect to the airlines, airports, and weather conditions.
